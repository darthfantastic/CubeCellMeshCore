sleep 1
echo "stats" > /dev/ttyUSB0
sleep 1
echo "identity" > /dev/ttyUSB0
sleep 1
echo "telemetry" > /dev/ttyUSB0
sleep 1
echo "nodes" > /dev/ttyUSB0
sleep 1
echo "contacts" > /dev/ttyUSB0
sleep 1

## Known Limitations

- Time sync requires receiving ADVERT from another synced node
- Alert/Report features require valid destination public key
- Some commands only available in non-LITE_MODE builds
- Deep sleep may interfere with serial reception

## Troubleshooting

**No serial output**: Check baud rate (115200), verify SILENT mode not enabled

**Commands not recognized**: Ensure complete command sent with newline

**ADVERT not visible in app**: Verify frequency/region match, check syncword (0x12)

**Radio errors**: Check antenna connection, verify radio initialization in boot log
